Do I need travel insurance?
If you are a citizen of an EU country and are traveling to EU destinations, we advise you to bring your blue European Health card in the trip. If you are traveling to outside the European union, you are not a citizen of an EU country or you just want more protection you may want to check insurance offerings from other companies.

How do I cancel a trip?
If you wish to cancel your trip you should contact the airlines and hotel providers. For most cases it is not possible to cancel trips and receive a refund. However, all the details for hotels and flights will be emailed to you and you may contact us for help and advice in any situation.

How do I know I can trust this travel vendor?
Nordico is extremely cautious when it comes to choosing our business partners. We work with reputable companies like Booking.com and Skyscanner to provide you a safe trip.
How does the booking process work?
After you select your package, we will provide you with all the steps needed to proceed with booking. We will not ask you for bank information. Instead, we will redirect you to individual pages where you will be able to book your flights and hotels.  We will organize the booking process and guide you step by step, to ensure a smooth and easy reservation.
What happens if one of my flights is canceled?
If you have been notified that your flight has been canceled please contact us. We will help you out mediating between the airline and booking new re-routing flights if necessary.
What Travel documents do I need?
Travel documents within the European unition
If you are citizen of an EU country you will need an ID card or passport if you are travelling within the European Union. And not just when you cross a border (for example, via an airport). You must also be able to show an ID card or passport if you are staying in a European country.
Travel documents outside Europe
Countries outside Europe only accept a valid passport as proof of identity. Most countries will not accept an expired passport. Many countries outside Europe also require a visa. After completing your reservation make sure that you apply for a visa when required and that you provide the relevant authorities your Nordico travel plan whenever necessary.
How Do I Plan My Tour?
When our engine builds a package, it seeks to let you stay the right time for each location. Not too little that you canÂ´t check the coolest attractions, not too much that you will get bored. Once you have completed your reservation you can plan what to visit in detail using platforms like google trips. You can also check our recommendations and feel free to contact us for tips.
What Is Included in Your Tour Cost?
